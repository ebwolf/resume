      "summary": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has historically sponsored volunteered data collection \nprojects to enhance its topographic paper and digital map products. This report describes one \nphase of an ongoing project to encourage volunteers to contribute data to The National Map\nusing online editing tools. The USGS recruited students studying geographic information \nsystems (GIS) at the University of Colorado Denver and the University of Denver in the spring \nof 2011 to add data on structures—manmade features such as schools, hospitals, and libraries—\nto four quadrangles covering metropolitan Denver. The USGS customized a version of the online \nPotlatch editor created by the OpenStreetMap project and populated it with 30 structure types \ndrawn from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), a USGS database of geographic \nfeatures. The students corrected the location and attributes of these points and added information \non structures that were missing. There were two rounds of quality control. Student volunteers \nreviewed each point, and an in-house review of each point by the USGS followed.  \nNine-hundred and thirty-eight structure points were initially downloaded from the USGS \ndatabase. Editing and quality control resulted in 1,214 structure points that were subsequently \nadded to The National Map. A post-project analysis of the data shows that after student edit and \npeer review, 92 percent of the points contributed by volunteers met National Map Accuracy \nStandards for horizontal accuracy. Lessons from this project will be applied to later phases. \nThese include: \nsimplifying editing tasks and the user interfaces,  \nstressing to volunteers the importance of adding structures that are missing, and \nemphasizing the importance of conforming to editorial guidelines for formatting names and \naddresses of structures.",

      "publisher": "Springer, Dordrecht",
      "releaseDate": "2012-08-10",
      "summary": "The Internet has brought many changes to the way geographic information is created and shared. One aspect that has not changed is metadata. Static spatial data quality descriptions were standardized in the mid-1990s and cannot accommodate the current climate of data creation where nonexperts are using mobile phones and other location-based devices on a continuous basis to contribute data to Internet mapping platforms. The usability of standard geospatial metadata is being questioned by academics and neogeographers alike. This chapter analyzes current discussions of metadata to demonstrate how the media shift that is occurring has affected requirements for metadata. Two case studies of metadata use are presented—online sharing of environmental information through a regional spatial data infrastructure in the early 2000s, and new types of metadata that are being used today in OpenStreetMap, a map of the world created entirely by volunteers. Changes in metadata requirements are examined for usability, the ease with which metadata supports coproduction of data by communities of users, how metadata enhances findability, and how the relationship between metadata and data has changed. We argue that traditional metadata associated with spatial data infrastructures is inadequate and suggest several research avenues to make this type of metadata more interactive and effective in the GeoWeb.",

      "summary": "Generalization and geoprocessing operations on geospatial information were once the domain of complex software running on high-performance workstations. Currently, these computationally intensive processes are the domain of desktop applications. Recent efforts have been made to move geoprocessing operations server-side in a distributed, web accessible environment. This paper initiates research into portable client-side generalization and geoprocessing operations as part of a larger effort in user-centered design for the US Geological Survey's The National Map. An implementation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) line simplification algorithm was created in the open source OpenLayers geoweb client. This algorithm implementation was benchmarked using differing data structures and browser platforms. The implementation and results of the benchmarks are discussed in the general context of client-side geoprocessing.",

      "name": "MAPPING CEMETERIES WITH BALLOON AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY",
      "publisher": "ASPRS 2008 Annual Conference",
      "releaseDate": "2008-04-28",
      "summary": "Many times, aerial photos via platforms like airplanes and helicopters are chosen for ground reference. Compared to\nsatellite-borne images, such aerial photos provide spatial details that allow investigators to closely examine features\nand their spatial distribution. Aerial mapping companies update their aerial photo archive once in several years,\neven once in decades in some areas. Requiring flight lines to fit special research needs normally is time consuming\nand expense prohibiting. This project demonstrates the use of balloon aerial photos for mapping small features over\na small geographic extent, e.g., gravestones in cemeteries. The imaging system consists of a consumer digital\ncamera, a camera mounting rig with picavet suspension, a balloon measured at 1.5 meter diameter filled with helium\n(sometimes a 2.8-square meter kite) , and a tether. The altitude of balloon was controlled by the tether at about 50\nmeter above the ground; resulting in high spatial resolution images at about 1.5 centimeter cell size. Another\nadvantage of the balloon aerial photography is the flexibility. As long as weather permits, the temporal resolution\ncan range from years, months, weeks, to days, hours, or even minutes. The system was tested on three cemeteries\nexhibiting several qualities of the Upland South Folk Cemetery complex near Chattanooga, Tennessee. Gravestones\nwere digitalized from these aerial photos. Locations and facing directions of gravestones are compared to ground\nmeasurements using DGPS.",

For its time, the  project was at the cutting edge of geographic information science (GIS) research. It combined traditional methods of digital mapping with emerging social media technologies. Erica was instrumental in the planning and implementation of this project. She is an extremely creative problem solver with an extraordinary command of the principles of both GIS and computer programming. Erica is an out-of-the-box thinker and a hard worker. I would not hesitate to recommend her for any position."

We have worked together in the USGS’ Center of Excellence for Geospatial Information Science. We both work on various geospatial research pertaining to The National Map and related technologies. Eric is very good at seeing how to fuse these and how we best employed the resulting work in the future.  He is a talented individual and a fine geographer and computer scientist.\r\n\r\nEric’s excitement for marrying together new Web technologies with geospatial data is wonderful. I know of his keenness for developing programming language libraries that are applicable to the semantic web. He is successful working in a research team and brings a no-nonsense approach to any task we have conduct together. Eric is in the process of developing a fine corpus of scientific work over these past two years.  He displays leadership by coordinating with research teams on related investigations into geospatial data generalization and ontology problems. I feel that his inclination for exactness is one of the reasons he has done well in many activities."

As a game developer to his academic career he could always hold an audience's attention with the thought that went into each task he was involved in.  He's a great listener and always working with others to find the \"best\" solution and not just a \"good\" solution."

What you do remember is that it started multiple business relationships and a friendship that transcends time and location. You know that Eric is a person whose attention to detail, process, and ways of thinking about and resolving problems are thoughts that you trust. You know that when Eric is faced with an option of an \"easy out\", and the \"right way\" of doing something, he'll choose the right way and make it work. You admire his ability to re-invent himself in ways that keep him ahead of the pack. I also worked with Eric on the qDebit project and look forward to working with him again some day. I heartily recommend Eric for anything without reservation."

He made it very easy for the artists like myself to work through the technical aspects of getting our creations to flow transparently with the game without sacrificing fidelity or creativity.  But on the network side, he helped me get our disparate (SGI, Mac, Linux and PC) systems to work together. At the time he was programming in C and C++, there's no better coder out there."

      "summary": "I was the lead systems administrator/programmer on a new incarnation of the US Geological Survey’s National Map Corps (TNMcorps).  The goal of the TNMcorps is to engage US citizens in improving the geospatial data that are integrated into The National Map. The TNMcorps has actually existed since the early 90s when citizens would “adopt a quad” (paper USGS topographic quadrangle maps) and make hand-edits to the map. The program evolved over the past two decades. In 2010, the current incarnation of TNMcorps was launched based on a copy of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) software platform.\n\nThe core OSM website is a Ruby on Rails application with a Postgres backend.  The site integrates the Javascript OpenLayers map interface and a ActionScript editing interface called Potlatch. In addition to the direct web interface, OSM provides a RESTful API for reading and writing data. To create the new TNMcorps system, I branched the OSM code on GitHub (https://github.com/ebwolf/openstreetmap-website) and made modifications throughout to meet USGS program needs and Federal compliance regulations. I also branched the Potlach2 code on GitHub (https://github.com/ebwolf/potlatch2) and modified the editor to provide a simplified user experience.  In addition to managing the TNMcorps platform, I have developed Python scripts to export the database into Esri ArcGIS File Geodatabase format for USGS internal processing\n",

      "summary": "Aerial Photography, normally acquired via platforms like airplanes and helicopters, is very expensive, requires significant lead-time, and lacks spatial resolution for small features. Large-scale imagery can be acquired using helium-balloon or kite platforms with consumer electronics at a significantly lower cost, at a higher spatial resolution and with more flexible temporal resolution. Increased spatial resolution allows for identification of small surface features such as cemetery headstones, power lines, and manhole covers. The spatial accuracy of images acquired through the low-cost large-scale method was assessed through identification of small spatial features common to the Upland South Cemetery. Unfortunately, the spatial accuracy of the features extracted from the imagery was relatively poor. However, the increased spatial resolutions and more flexible temporal resolutions were very useful in documenting spatial and cultural aspects of the Upland South Cemetery.\n\nUnfortunately, the electronic link to the PDF of my thesis is no longer being maintained.
